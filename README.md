# Designing Good Programs with Types

Jason Chen and CJ Quines

</div>

Learn how types can help you be a better programmer! We'll learn some functional programming, and some type theory principles that apply no matter what language you're using. Learn about how type safety can give us better mental models, what algebraic datatypes or dataclasses are, the importance of pure functions and testing, the meaning of "parse, don't validate", and type-safe error handling. There'll be exercises and projects where you get to apply what we're learning.
